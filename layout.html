  	   	  <h1>HUMANS vs ROBOTS</h1>
		  <p>In recent years, we have witnessed robots and machines replacing many jobs that used to be done by people. The questions on everyoneâ€™s mind are when will it stop, will robots replace humans in everything, what jobs will be left? As technology continues to progress, robots are becoming cleverer than people and computers learn to perform tasks with greater efficiency than us, it is worrying to think that one day robots will be in every workplace and there will be fewer and fewer jobs available for people.</p>

  	   	  <h1>Will robots replace humans?</h1>
		  <p>One of the most interesting debates that have come to prominence recently because of rapid technological innovation is whether the technology invented has the ability to replace its very creators. The job industry has come very far today with industrial machinery and online applications that have replaced the need for human labour. For instance, assembly line work has been replaced by machines, customer service has adapted to automated response systems, and even banking has shifted to online means. The need for humans to do certain tasks in this day and age has objectively been reduced. However, the larger question still remains: will robots completely diminish the need for humans in the workforce at all?</p>

       	 <h1>The Final Verdict</h1>
    <p>However, looking at robots from a broad perspective, we can say that there is no matching robots when it comes to speed, accuracy, efficiency and logical ability, but humans still have an edge over the machines due to their intellect, spontaneity, creative thinking, and multi-layered methods of planning ahead of time. Our curiosity and instincts are also advantages, but they are far harder to quantify.</p>
